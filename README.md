## 🚀 About Me

I am a PhD student, passionate about understanding and applying Model Order Reduction (MOR) techniques using MATLAB. My research aims to simplify complex dynamical systems to improve simulation and control, with a strong focus on mathematical accuracy and computational efficiency.

As a PhD researcher:

I explore key Model Order Reduction (MOR) methods such as POD, Krylov, and Balanced Truncation.

I am constantly learning through experimentation and collaboration.

I am open to feedback, advice, and knowledge sharing to deepen my understanding and hone my skills.

# 🧠 Model Order Reduction with MATLAB

Welcome to my MATLAB-based repository for exploring **Model Order Reduction (MOR)** techniques. I'm a **researcher passionate about understanding and applying MOR** methods, and I welcome contributions, suggestions, and learning collaborations from others interested in this field.

This project focuses on simplifying complex dynamical systems while preserving essential behaviors—ideal for control engineering, simulations, and optimization.

## 📌 Overview

Model Order Reduction (MOR) is a powerful mathematical framework used to reduce the computational complexity of high-dimensional models. This repository includes:
- MATLAB implementations of popular MOR techniques
- Test cases and performance comparisons
- Visualization scripts for reduced vs. full-order models

## 🚀 Techniques Included

- Balanced Truncation  
- Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)  
- Krylov Subspace Methods  
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)  
- Greedy Algorithms (for nonlinear systems)


## 🛠 Requirements

- MATLAB R2020+ (preferably with Control System Toolbox)  
- Basic understanding of linear algebra and dynamical systems

## ✨ Goals

- Demonstrate efficiency of reduced models in simulation  
- Compare accuracy vs. speed trade-offs  
- Provide reusable code for MOR applications

## 📈 Future Work

- Extend MOR techniques to nonlinear and time-varying systems  
- Integrate with Simulink models  
- Add GUI for interactive experimentation

## 🤝 Contribution

As a researcher still learning and exploring the field, I’m eager to connect with others who can help me grow.  
Feel free to fork, star 🌟, or submit pull requests.  
Suggestions, corrections, and insights are warmly welcome.
