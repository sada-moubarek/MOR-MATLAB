# MOR-MATLAB
MODEL ORDER REDUCTION
# 🧠 Model Order Reduction with MATLAB

Welcome to my MATLAB-based repository for exploring **Model Order Reduction (MOR)** techniques. This project focuses on simplifying complex dynamical systems while preserving essential behaviors—ideal for control engineering, simulations, and optimization.

## 📌 Overview

Model Order Reduction (MOR) is a powerful mathematical framework used to reduce the computational complexity of high-dimensional models. This repository includes:
- MATLAB implementations of popular MOR techniques
- Test cases and performance comparisons
- Visualization scripts for reduced vs. full-order models

## 🚀 Techniques Included

- Balanced Truncation
- Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
- Krylov Subspace Methods
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Greedy Algorithms (for nonlinear systems)

## 📁 Project Structure


## 🛠 Requirements

- MATLAB R2020+ (preferably with Control System Toolbox)
- Basic understanding of linear algebra and dynamical systems

## ✨ Goals

- Demonstrate efficiency of reduced models in simulation
- Compare accuracy vs. speed trade-offs
- Provide reusable code for MOR applications

## 📈 Future Work

- Extend MOR techniques to nonlinear and time-varying systems
- Integrate with Simulink models
- Add GUI for interactive experimentation
